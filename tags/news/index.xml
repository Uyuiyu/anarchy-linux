      <description>tl;dr Join our Matrix chat group using Riot.im.
With the renewal of the Anarchy brand/workflow/mission we have come to realise that even though there aren&amp;rsquo;t many of us working on Anarchy, we didn&amp;rsquo;t have a good way to communicate with one another. We also wanted our users to be able to voice their opinions and talk about the project in a more chatty setting, not only through Github issues.
We discussed using the very popular Telegram messaging platform, but have later decided to use the Matrix network/platform, since it was completely open source (unlike Telegram&amp;rsquo;s infrastructure) and decentralised, allowing us to move providers and possibly self-host if needed.</description>
