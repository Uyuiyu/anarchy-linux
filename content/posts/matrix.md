tl;dr Join [our Matrix chat group](https://matrix.to/#/+anarchy-linux:matrix.org) using [Riot.im](https://about.riot.im/).

With the renewal of the Anarchy brand/workflow/mission we have come to realise
that even though there aren't many of us working on Anarchy, we didn't have a
good way to communicate with one another. We also wanted our users to be able
to voice their opinions and talk about the project in a more chatty setting,
not only through Github issues.

We discussed using the very popular [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) messaging
platform, but have later decided to use the [Matrix](https://matrix.org/)
network/platform, since it was completely open source (unlike Telegram's infrastructure)
and decentralised, allowing us to move providers and possibly self-host if needed.

Since Matrix is only the underlying protocol, you will still need a client if
you want to communicate in our group.
This is where [Riot.im](https://about.riot.im/) comes in.
It is an open source Matrix client, which supports a bunch of platforms and
all the features we'll ever need.

Thus we are inviting you to join [our Matrix group](https://matrix.to/#/+anarchy-linux:matrix.org)
and talk with other people (including us developers) about Anarchy,
the problems you have with it and discuss future ideas about the project.

Happy chatting!
